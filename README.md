# Task5-Train-Test-Split-and-Evaluation-Metrics
This task demonstrates the implementation of train–test split and model evaluation using the Heart Disease dataset. A Logistic Regression model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. These metrics help in understanding overall performance, correctness of positive predictions, and the model’s ability to identify actual heart disease cases.

The task provides practical understanding of model evaluation fundamentals in machine learning.
